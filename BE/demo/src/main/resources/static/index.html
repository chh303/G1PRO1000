            <p>
                We are committed to promoting sustainable programming practices that help reduce the environmental impact of digital technologies. As technology continues to evolve, so does its energy footprint — and developers have a key role in making the software industry more climate-conscious.
                <br><br>
                Every line of code matters. Inefficient systems can waste significant energy over time, while well-structured and optimized solutions lead to better performance and lower emissions. By raising awareness and sharing tools, insights, and real-world examples, we aim to make green coding both accessible and actionable.
                <br><br>
                Through collaboration and education, we empower developers and organizations to build cleaner, more efficient software. Greener code means faster apps, lower costs, and a healthier planet — one efficient line at a time.

            <div class="tekst-og-bilde">
            <img src="/images/stock5.jpg"style="width: 350px; height: auto;">
            <p>
                Software may be virtual, but it depends entirely on physical infrastructure — real machines that consume real energy. Every inefficient loop, redundant task, or unnecessary request increases power usage and contributes to carbon emissions.
                <br><br>
                What often feels like a small inefficiency in code can scale massively in production environments. Multiply that across millions of users, and the environmental impact becomes significant. 
                <br><br>
                Sustainable programming tackles this hidden cost by improving efficiency, reducing hardware strain, and lowering energy demands. It supports a cleaner, faster, and more responsible future for technology.

            <h2>🧠 What You Can Do</h2>
            <div class="tekst-og-bilde">
            <p>
                Developers have the power to shape more sustainable digital systems. Writing efficient, well-structured code is a simple but impactful way to cut down on unnecessary energy use.
                <br><br>
                Choosing eco-friendly infrastructure and optimizing backend logic — such as minimizing server calls, reducing memory waste, or refining loops — can make a measurable difference in performance and power consumption.
                <br><br>
                Embracing green coding isn’t just about helping the planet. It also leads to faster applications, lower operational costs, and codebases that are easier to maintain and scale.

                As IT students, we’ve taken on a project dedicated to exploring and promoting green coding practices in the tech industry. Our goal is to raise awareness about how software can be both effective and environmentally responsible.
                <br><br>
                We’re building a platform that shares knowledge, practical tools, and case studies focused on sustainable software development. It’s a space for learning, inspiration, and real-world application.
                <br><br>
                Through hands-on coding, research, and collaboration, we aim to support a more energy-conscious future in tech — and encourage others to join the movement toward greener code.
